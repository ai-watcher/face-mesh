# Face Mesh Web App with Streamlit and OpenCV
I've designed this Web Application based on a OpenCV with the help of Streamlit. It uses static image file and video file including webcam video to detect faces and draw mesh around faces.

```console
pip install streamlit
pip install opencv-python-headless
pip install mediapipe
pip install Pillow
pip install numpy
```
